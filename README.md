# SuShare

**Save together, pay together**

## Overview

SuShare aims to solve the difficult problem of incentivizing savings. Borrowing from an old-school savings method popular in Carribean and African communities known as a su-su, SuShare aims to translate this traditional savings model to the modern age of tech and communication. Using the model of a su-su, a group of users contributes an equal amount of money weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or a customized regular basis. Each payment period, the lump sum is paid out to one of the users, and rotates around the group until everyone receives their share. <br />

SuShare takes this concept to the next level by adding social networking features, allowing you to create SuShares with friends and family, or with other online users over mutual savings interests. Stripe integration allows for a intuitave and secure payment rotation that elevates the security of a su-su to a new level. <br />
